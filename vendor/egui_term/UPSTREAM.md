Vendored from https://github.com/kemokempo/egui_term at 31bbc7ab8503c9518fcee5717cfa29011e59f451. MIT license retained. Workspace manifest simplified and egui advanced from 0.35 to 0.36 for egui_dock compatibility. Local changes are documented here as made.

Local integration changes: expose a path token lookup for the context menu; allow keyboard input to the focused terminal when the pointer is elsewhere while preserving pointer hit testing.

The daemon answers terminal queries, so the widget does not send duplicate replies. Event subscription exits cleanly when its receiver is gone.

## Islands typography (2026-09-08)

Default size is 13 logical points. Font measurement applies 1.2 line spacing and
ceil-quantizes both cell dimensions once; PTY grid sizing, paint, cursor, selection,
mouse coordinates and pixel-wheel scrolling use that same geometry. Bold cells
use the host's optional `Terminal Bold` font family, falling back to the normal
family for other embedders. Default foreground/background are Islands Dark
#D1D3D9/#191A1C; terminal applications can still supply ANSI/truecolor colors.

## Plan 3 target actions (2026-09-08)

Added `LinkTarget` and `TerminalBackend::target_at`: a bounded logical-line scan
across grid wrapping and scrollback, skipping wide-character spacer cells, with
quoted-path tokenization and local underline rectangles. The widget performs no
filesystem access. The application resolves targets on its worker and supplies
hover actions. `TerminalView::external_links(true)` delegates modified-click
opening to the application while retaining terminal mouse reporting and ordinary
selection. Standalone users retain the original link behavior by default.

The native fixture checks pointer hover -> editor split; widget unit tests cover
quoted spaces, punctuation, wrapping, scrolling and wide-cell hit testing.

The flat terminal context menu adds `select_all()` and reads copied selection text
from the cached grid, including offscreen history, wrapped lines, combining marks,
and wide-cell spacing. Copying does not acquire an additional live terminal lock
while rendering. A regression checks offscreen copying and newline preservation.
