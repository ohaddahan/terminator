# Terminator

A native Rust terminal workspace for macOS and Linux. Projects have independent split layouts; a local daemon keeps shells and editors alive when the GUI closes. Agent hooks feed a configurable attention bar.

## Build and run

Requires Rust 1.95+, a C compiler for the bundled CodeDiff library, and a native desktop. Install Neovim for the default embedded editor; Git reviews require Neovim 0.10+ on PATH.

```sh
cd terminator
cargo build --workspace --locked
cargo run -p terminator --locked
```

Build all three executables together: `terminator`, `terminator-daemon`, and `terminator-hook`. The GUI starts the daemon if needed. Keep the executables beside one another.

On macOS, build a local app bundle:

```sh
cargo xtask package
open target/package/Terminator.app
```

`--debug` produces a faster development bundle. Bundles are signed ad hoc locally; they are not notarized or published. On Linux, the same task produces a relocatable archive and desktop entry. X11 and Wayland backends are compiled; native file selection uses the desktop's XDG portal on Linux and NSOpenPanel on macOS.

Debian/Ubuntu desktop runtime libraries include `libxkbcommon-x11-0`, `libxkbcommon0`, `libgl1`, and the usual X11/Wayland desktop libraries. Install an XDG desktop portal backend appropriate to your desktop for file dialogs. `cargo xtask linux-check` configures a disposable Linux test container; `scripts/README.md` lists the Rust validation tasks.

## Daily workflow

- Add a project through the native folder picker. File and folder pickers start at the focused terminal's current directory, falling back to the selected project and launch directory.
- Open a terminal. The automatic shell preference is **zsh → bash → sh**, selecting the first installed executable. Settings accepts an explicit shell override; clear it to restore automatic selection.
- Use **+** in the top-level tab strip to create a terminal tab with its own split layout. Explorer hides Git-ignored entries by default; **Show ignored files** reveals them (including Git metadata). Ordinary dotfiles remain visible.
- Right-click a terminal or its tab for **New tab**, **Split up**, **Split down**, **Split left**, and **Split right**. Each split stays inside its owning top-level tab.
- Launch agents and manage worktrees in the terminal yourself. The app does not launch agents or perform Git writes.
- Project arrows expand/collapse independently of selection and persist across restarts. The window header holds project tabs and the Explorer, Agents, Git, and Settings icons. Explorer, Agents, and Git switch the right sidebar; click the active tool to collapse it. Agents can show the owning project or All projects. Sidebar width and scope persist globally.
- Select a project to restore its own layout. A terminal that changes directory stays under its owning project; the file/Git sidebar follows its effective directory.
- Single-click anywhere on an Explorer file row to open a new editor tab. Right-click a file path to open the editor, a new editor split, or an external editor. `command+O` uses the native file picker (Cmd+O on macOS, Ctrl+Shift+O on Linux). Change it in Settings → Shortcuts.
- Settings → Terminal & Editor retains embedded Neovim, terminal-editor, and external-editor modes. External presets include System default, VS Code, Cursor, RustRover, Zed, and Custom. Named presets use macOS application launching or Linux CLI launchers. Custom takes an executable and one literal argument per row; the absolute file path is appended without shell evaluation. **Choose file and test…** launches the draft without saving. Missing launchers and failed exits appear in the status bar; long-running editors remain independent of the GUI.
- The default editor is real Neovim, rendered inside the native terminal widget and controlled through Neovim RPC for save/compare actions. Your Neovim configuration and plugins load normally. An editor-side tree can therefore come from your own configuration.
- Closing a tab with live shells or agents asks whether to terminate or background them. Clean file-only tabs close directly. Closing the GUI leaves the daemon and sessions running.
- After a reboot or daemon loss, historical tabs show retained output and known resume commands. Agents are never restarted automatically.

## Agent setup

Settings → Agent hooks installs, repairs, and removes managed hooks for Claude Code, Codex, OpenCode, Muse, and Grok. Installation preserves unrelated hooks and writes a backup before changing an existing configuration. It never installs agent binaries or configures accounts.

Read [the integration contract and capability notes](docs/INTEGRATIONS.md) before connecting a custom agent. Installed hooks are inert outside terminals owned by this application. Notification defaults cover input, permission, completion, and failure events where the agent exposes them; opening the relevant terminal dismisses the notification without changing agent state.

## Local state and updates

The default data directory follows the OS application-data convention. `TERMINATOR_DATA_DIR=/absolute/path` or `terminator --data-dir /absolute/path` selects an isolated installation. The runtime directory contains a private Unix socket and authentication file; do not share these files.

SQLite stores projects, layouts, session metadata, agent state, and notification state. `ui-preferences.json` stores versioned per-installation navigation/sidebar choices and the one-time typography and Attention migration markers. Attention moves to the right sidebar once after the daemon acknowledges the settings update; later placement choices are preserved. The Islands update sets terminal/editor size to 13 once; subsequent user size choices are preserved. Inter and JetBrains Mono are bundled with their licenses. Scrollback is stored separately and pruned by configurable age/per-session/total limits. Defaults: 30 days, 50 MiB/session, 2 GiB total. Metadata and resume commands remain until explicitly removed. Truncated output is labeled.

A running daemon keeps its current executable version until it exits. GUI updates can reconnect to compatible running daemons. To update daemon behavior, explicitly stop its sessions and then stop it; do not kill a daemon with live work merely to reload a build. Low-level control is available through `terminator-hook rpc` (JSON requests documented by `terminator-core::Request`). For example, `terminator-hook rpc '"Shutdown"'` refuses while any sessions remain live.

## Validation

```sh
cargo fmt --all --check
cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets --all-features -- -D warnings
cargo test --workspace --all-features --locked
cargo build --workspace --bins --examples --features terminator/test-support --locked
cargo xtask integration
cargo xtask gui all
cargo xtask gui ui-cleanup --output /tmp/terminator-ui-2x --scale 2
```

The `test-support` feature enables opt-in renderer capture and synthetic input only when the test environment requests them. Normal builds do not include that code. Tests use temporary directories and do not install hooks into your agent configurations.

See [unreleased changes](CHANGELOG.md), [panic audit](docs/PANIC_AUDIT.md), [architecture](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md), [validation evidence](docs/VALIDATION.md), and [upstream widget changes](vendor/egui_term/UPSTREAM.md). Native desktop notification permissions/actions, Wayland desktop behavior, and all live provider-specific event combinations require separate desktop/provider validation; a build or synthetic hook fixture does not establish them.

## Appearance and navigation

Appearance is stored as a versioned `[appearance]` table in
`~/.config/terminator/config.toml` on macOS and Linux. `XDG_CONFIG_HOME` replaces
`~/.config`; `TERMINATOR_CONFIG_DIR` overrides the configuration directory.
Explicit `--data-dir` or `TERMINATOR_DATA_DIR` installations keep `config.toml`
in their isolated data directory. A missing file uses defaults without creating
it. For example:

```toml
[appearance]
version = 1
window = "#26282C"
surface = "#191A1C"
text = "#D1D3D9"
accent = "#3871E1"
border_width = 1.0
pane_divider_width = 8.0
```

Settings shows all supported tokens, including terminal, selection, Git and
agent-state colors. Valid edits preview immediately. Apply saves atomically and
preserves comments and unrelated TOML keys; Cancel restores the committed theme.
Reset appearance changes only the draft. Invalid external edits retain the last
valid theme and display an error. An externally changed configuration requires
reloading a dirty draft before saving. Functional settings and navigation remain
in their existing stores; font choices are not part of the appearance file.

Ended sessions are under initially collapsed History sections, with expansion
saved per project. Each project has a top-level tab strip, and each tab owns an
independent split layout and pane focus. Clicking a file opens a new top-level
editor tab; explicit editor-split actions stay in the current tab. Async split
creation stays in its originating tab, even if you navigate elsewhere.

Explorer and Git share filename icons and status colors. Git separates conflicts,
staged changes, working-tree changes and untracked files; a partially staged file
appears in both applicable groups and opens the corresponding diff. Native
filesystem notifications are debounced by 250 ms. Visible panels reconcile every
30 seconds, or poll every three seconds if watching fails. Hidden panels suspend
refresh work. The app leaves Git fsmonitor configuration alone.

Hover an HTTP(S) URL or existing file path for 400 ms to show actions. Paths are
resolved against the originating session directory, including `~/`, quoted spaces,
and `file:line:column`. Cmd-click (macOS) or Ctrl-click (Linux) opens the default
action. Terminal mouse-reporting applications keep their input behavior. No
Tree-sitter dependency is needed for these targets; Neovim owns editor syntax.


The top-level tab strip sits above the split workspace. Every pane has a compact
title caption and right-click actions for splitting, finding text, saving/comparing
an editor, and closing a session. Legacy stacks of panes remain accessible through
“Tabs in this pane” in the context menu. A normal click on an
existing Git file opens its editor; staged and working-tree diffs remain in the
file menu. Deleted entries open a diff because there is no current file to edit.

Git → right-click a file → **Staged diff** or **Working tree diff** opens a
separate Neovim review tab with bundled CodeDiff. Neovim 0.10+ must be on PATH;
users do not install plugins. The review uses an isolated Neovim profile, without
loading user configuration. Ordinary file editors still use the editor settings.
Use `]c` / `[c` for changes, `t` for inline/side-by-side layout, `gc` to fold
unchanged context, and `q` or the tab X to close without a session prompt.

Reviews are read-only snapshots: HEAD → index for staged changes, index → disk
for working changes. Reopen a review to refresh it. Renames, added/deleted files,
untracked files and partially staged files are supported. Two-way reviews reject
unresolved conflicts, binary/non-UTF-8 files, symlinks/submodules, and files over
1 MiB with an error. Git mutations remain terminal operations. Older saved native
diff tabs keep their existing renderer. The GUI checks the running daemon’s
advertised capabilities before opening a review. With an older daemon it uses
the built-in diff and explains that Neovim review needs a daemon update, keeping
live sessions intact. Restarting just the GUI loads this compatibility fix;
building a package does not replace a running daemon.

CodeDiff and its C diff library are pinned and bundled in the daemon, built locally
with the C compiler used by Cargo; there are no first-use downloads or OpenMP
runtime dependency. Attribution and upgrade instructions are in
[`vendor/codediff.nvim/UPSTREAM.md`](vendor/codediff.nvim/UPSTREAM.md).

Settings has category navigation and grouped appearance controls. The attention
bar distinguishes missing managed hooks from having no pending agent events.
Configure an agent under Settings → Agent Hooks, then start a fresh agent CLI
inside a Terminator terminal to receive its initial lifecycle events. Merely
running an agent process does not produce events; Terminator does not install
hooks or infer agent state from terminal text automatically.


The selected terminal is outlined with the appearance accent color (blue by
default). Rename a terminal through its right-click menu, its tab menu, or its
Projects row; double-clicking a top tab also edits its name inline. Press Enter to save or Escape to cancel.

File opening always creates a separate editor session in a new top-level tab.
Use “Open in editor split” to place an editor beside a pane in the current tab. When Vim exits, its view closes
and focus returns to the originating session when available. Closing or exiting
the last session in any split removes that pane and expands its sibling. Ended
records remain in History, and stale ended panes are cleaned up on GUI restart.

All panes display a compact terminal-title caption inside their top border. Click it to focus the pane, or double-click/right-click to rename it.


Existing project layouts migrate into the first top-level tab without restarting
sessions or changing their split arrangement. Tab order, selected tab, and each
tab's layout/focus are saved in version 2 of the project's layout JSON; the daemon
protocol and SQLite schema are unchanged. Use the updated GUI with these layouts.
Unknown layout versions are reported and are not overwritten.

Closing a top-level tab containing shells or active agents offers keeping them
running in the background or terminating them. A sidebar session click locates its owning tab, or restores a
background session into a new top-level tab using the same process. Quitting a
sole editor removes its tab and restores the other tab's last focused pane.

Focus outlines briefly emphasize a newly selected terminal, then fade to a thin, soft outline. File-editor pane captions include an X button with the existing close/save choices.

Top-level tabs use a flat strip with a terminal icon, close button, and muted active underline. Renaming edits the label in place on the tab, pane caption, or sidebar row; valid edits also save when focus leaves the field.


Clean file-only tabs and editor panes close directly without a terminal-session
confirmation. If any editor buffer has unsaved changes, choose Save and close,
Discard changes, or Cancel. Tabs containing shells or active agents retain the
session-close confirmation. Double-clicking an Explorer/Git file opens one editor,
not a duplicate editor for the second click.

Explorer uses Git colors on filenames, icons, and badges: **U** for untracked,
**M/A/D/R/C/T** for tracked changes, and **!** for conflicts. Conflicts take
precedence, followed by working-tree status and then staged status. Folder
badges aggregate descendants, prioritizing conflicts and deletions. Hover the
Explorer icon for the effective directory and any last-known-directory qualifier.

## Native previews and explicit controls

Click PNG, JPEG, WebP, GIF, BMP, ICO, TIFF, or SVG files to open a native image tab.
Fit, 100%, pan/zoom, Reload, Open as text, and Open externally are available.
Raster previews decode in a bounded worker and use the first frame of animated
formats. SVGs are rasterized with resvg; external references are not loaded.
Corrupt or over-limit images display an error instead of opening binary text.
Image-bearing layouts use version 3; ordinary version-2 workspaces remain readable.
Older GUIs refuse the newer layout rather than overwriting it.

`terminator-hook ctl --help` exposes explicit controls. Examples:

```sh
terminator-hook ctl add-project /absolute/project
terminator-hook ctl create PROJECT_ID
terminator-hook ctl create PROJECT_ID --background
terminator-hook ctl split SESSION_ID right
terminator-hook ctl send SESSION_ID 'cargo test' --enter
terminator-hook ctl read SESSION_ID --screen
terminator-hook ctl open-file PROJECT_ID /absolute/image.png
terminator-hook ctl worktree add PROJECT_ID /absolute/task-checkout --branch task-name
terminator-hook ctl worktree list PROJECT_ID
terminator-hook ctl worktree remove WORKTREE_PROJECT_ID
terminator-hook ctl metadata SESSION_ID --pr
terminator-hook ctl notify SESSION_ID 'Build finished'
```

The GUI control endpoint is a private authenticated `gui.sock`; the daemon retains
its existing versioned JSON socket. Unsupported daemon features fail before any
worktree mutation. UI commands acknowledge acceptance; layouts retain the usual
asynchronous persistence behavior. Worktree removal keeps branches and historical
session records, and refuses dirty/locked checkouts or projects with live sessions.
Starting work from another checkout resolves HEAD in that checkout.

Selected-context metadata includes branch, worktree status, listening ports from
the session process tree, and optional PR details through `gh`. PR lookup is opt-in
in Settings, cached for 60 seconds; ports refresh every 3 seconds and repository
metadata every 30 seconds. Missing helpers and lookup failures are exposed in the
metadata result. A terminal notification is distinct from an authenticated agent
lifecycle event; OSC 9, OSC 777 notify, and OSC 99 title/body messages are supported.
Desktop delivery of terminal messages is separately configurable.

External-browser automation stays outside the native application. Use
`terminator-hook ctl browser open URL` for the system browser. For an existing
local CDP page endpoint, the browser subcommands `navigate`, `snapshot`, `click`,
`fill`, `evaluate`, and `screenshot` accept `--endpoint ws://127.0.0.1:PORT/devtools/page/ID`.
They neither embed nor download a browser. A remote endpoint requires an explicit
local tunnel. HTML/CSS snapshots and screenshots are produced only when requested.
