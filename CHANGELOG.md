# Changelog

## Unreleased

- Refuse worktree removal when another project's live session, editor file or
  child process uses the checkout, including symlink paths and missing cwd hooks.
- Negotiate chunked snapshots when state exceeds the 8 MiB frame limit, retaining
  all pending notifications and their details. Legacy oversized requests receive
  an explicit error; ordinary snapshots retain their existing format.
- Close both attachment directions on output failure while preserving the PTY
  for reattachment.
- Use editor-specific launch arguments in terminal-editor mode; custom programs
  receive the absolute file operand without Neovim startup commands.

- Extract settings, sidebar, dialog and workspace rendering into sibling app
  modules while retaining `App` state and daemon PTY ownership.
- Reject saved layouts with invalid pane focus or a missing main surface, report
  the error and preserve the original layout. Record retained runtime assertions
  and their invariants in the [panic audit](docs/PANIC_AUDIT.md).
- Test that clean locked worktrees refuse removal through the Git helper and
  daemon/CLI, retaining files, locks, registration and branch references. Verify
  successful removal after unlocking without deleting the branch.
- Refresh development and CodeDiff validation instructions to use `cargo xtask`.

Compatibility: additive, opt-in snapshot response framing; no dependency,
persistence-format or protocol-version bump.
Running daemons keep their binary version until they exit; building or reopening
only the GUI does not replace them. Neovim reviews require the advertised
`nvim-review-v1` capability and Neovim 0.10+; older daemons use the built-in diff.
Image-bearing layouts use version 3; ordinary version-2 layouts remain readable,
and unknown versions are preserved without writes.
